### Solution

Visiting the website provided, there's an image that can be controlled by the user to slap a person with milk.

We can take a look around at the website source code but there's nothing really interesting. Since, this is a forensics challenge, maybe there's something we need to do with the image that's provided. Let's download it and take a look.

The image seems to have many frames captured in it of the person being milkslapped. Let's get some information about the image. I use `file`, `binwalk`, `strings` and `exiftool` on the file but nothing interesting found.

PNGs can be used to hide data using LSB steganography techniques. One such tool that tries to detect hidden data is `zsteg`. In this case, it gets us the flag.
