### Author: Alex Fulton/Daniel Tunitis

### Description

```
Category: Cryptography

I found this cipher in an old book. Can you figure out what it says? Connect with <code>nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 5726</code>.

Hints:

(1) There are tools that make this easy.

(2) Perhaps looking at history will help

### Solution

Looking at the cipher text, it seems it's been encrypted with common ciphers. Just giving Viginere cipher a try, we get the flag. I use [this](https://www.guballa.de/vigenere-solver) to crack Viginere ciphers.

It is interesting how in history people often receive credit for things they did not create

During the course of history, the VigenÃ¨re Cipher has been reinvented many times

It was falsely attributed to Blaise de VigenÃ¨re as it was originally described in 1553 by Giovan Battista Bellaso in his book La cifra del. Sig. Giovan Battista Bellaso 

For the implementation of this cipher a table is formed by sliding the lower half of an ordinary alphabet for an apparently random number of places with respect to the upper halfpicoCTF{b311a50_0r_v1gn3r3_c1ph3r6fe60eaa}

The first well-documented description of a polyalphabetic cipher however, was made around 1467 by Leon Battista Alberti.

The VigenÃ¨re Cipher is therefore sometimes called the Alberti Disc or Alberti Cipher.

In 1508, Johannes Trithemius invented the so-called tabula recta (a matrix of shifted alphabets) that would later be a critical component of the VigenÃ¨re Cipher.

Bellasoâ€™s second booklet appeared in 1555 as a continuation of the first. The lower halves of the alphabets are now shifted regularly, but the alphabets and the index letters are mixed by means of a mnemonic key phrase, which can be different with each correspondent.
