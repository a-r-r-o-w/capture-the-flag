There is a nice program that you can talk to by using this command in a shell: <code>$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 43239</code>, but it doesn't speak English...

Hints:

(1) You can practice using netcat with this picoGym problem: <a href='https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/34'>what's a netcat?</a>

(2) You can practice reading and writing ASCII with this picoGym problem: <a href='https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/22'>Let's Warm Up</a>

```

### Solution

Connecting with nc, we get the following result:

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(arrow) ðŸ’€ [~/Desktop/ctf/picoctf/Nice netcat...]
â””â”€$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 43239

â”Œâ”€â”€(arrow) ðŸ’€ [~/Desktop/ctf/picoctf/Nice netcat...]
â””â”€$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 43239 > numbers.txt
```

Looks like ASCII values for what might be the flag?

```python
with open('numbers.txt') as file:
  content = file.readlines()

for line in content:
  print(chr(int(line.strip())), end = '')
```

##### Flag: `picoCTF{g00d_k1tty!_n1c3_k1tty!_7c0821f5}`
