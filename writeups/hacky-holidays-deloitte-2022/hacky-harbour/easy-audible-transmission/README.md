A challenge file called `SecretMessage.wav` has been provided.

### For your eyes only [25 points]

Let's try to look at the file metadata and exif info to see if anything interesting is present.

Nothing interesting...

Listening to the file, we can notice that there are some very weird sounds that are being played. Let's try to "see", as per the challenge statement, the audio file by opening it up with `sonic-visualiser SecretMessage.wav` and applying a Spectogram layer.

**Flag:** `CTF{Tagalog}`.

### Code [75 points]

> We think it may have something to do with a code, can you find it?

When you hear the audio, there are three parts that sound different (also visible in the screenshot above). The first and third part have the flag but the second part sounds like an automated voice someone speaking. However, it sounds _really_ weird to be considered a normal language. The audio is actually reversed due to which it sounds the way it does.

We can reverse the audio back to normal using a tool called **Audacity** - use `Audacity > Effect > Reverse`. Also, searching for `Tagalog` on Google points us to the `Filipino` language. We can use Google Translate to translate our audio.

The rough tranlation is "make sure they don't get this code. the flag is 649444".

**Flag:** `649444`
