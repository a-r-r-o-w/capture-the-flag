# Hacky Harbour

> You passed the customs check point and entered the Hacky Harbour by spoofing the Hackazon Admin shield. The harbour is in total chaos, the ships are no longer on course; explosions have been spotted in the factory and even computers that have not been touched for more than 30 years have started to communicate on the network again.

The [Hacky Harbour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4839CR7FTM) was the first set of challenges that were made available during the event. A total of 8 challenges with multiple sub-challenges were dropped for the participants.
