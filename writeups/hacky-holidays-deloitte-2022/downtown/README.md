# Downtown

> The Downtown district has been plagued by hacked traffic lights (showing only smileys), communication systems are acting up, and it is dangerous to walk around in the city with self-driving vehicles driving around erratically. Other issues have been a cause of big annoyance, like pizzas being delivered to the wrong address with the wrong toppings, drones being stuck in the air, and cats being reported missing!

The [Downtown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SQ0MN0xzgw) was the last set of challenges that were made available during the event. A total of 11 challenges with multiple sub-challenges were dropped for the participants.
