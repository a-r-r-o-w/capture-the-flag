The NFT museum was hit hard with all images being scrambled and blurred, ATMs are infected with ransomware, ones and zeroes are flipped, payments and transfers are going to the wrong accounts, and the trading market has plummeted. This is even more visible in the city, with all the digital advertising billboards now displaying its propaganda.
