# Engineer CTF

There were many CTFs this weekend - PragyanCTF, UMDCTF, EngineerCTF, FooBarCTF and D^3CTF. We tried taking part in all of them but due to our in-semester assessments, we were under a lot of time pressure to study and focus on university subjects. Nonetheless, we still took part and tried our best for a few hours to grind out some challenges in all of them.

This is about the EngineerCTF challenges - a beginner friendly CTF organised but NIT Surathkal. We ranked #10 on the leaderboard. Could've done much better though but let's just use the ISAs as an excuse :p

#### THE CAT KNOWS THE CULPRIT

> Detective Jake Peralta and his partner Charles Boyle are assigned a Grand Larceny case, by their captain Raymond Holt. Upon their arrival to crime scene they find that there are no clues for them to catch the victim, so they leave the crime scene and at the exif exit door they find an image along with a note saying "THE CAT KNOWS THE CULPRIT."

We are provided with a challenge file `clue.jfif`.

<img src="./images/clue.jfif" alt="clue.jfif" style="zoom:25%;" />

Running `exiftool` and looking at _Comment_ or running `strings clue.jfif | grep CTF` gives us our flag.

**Flag:** `CTF{It_1s_D0UG_JUdY}`



#### I can do this all day

> **Tony Stark:** a hacker who's faster than ultron? he could be anywhere GLOBAL. And as this is the center of everything, I'm just a REGULAR guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack.
>
> **World Hub Tech:** How do you find it? <with puzzled EXPRESSION>
>
> **Tony Stark:** pretty simple. you bring a magnet.
>
> Flag format: CTF{...}

We are provided with a zip file that unzip into multiple text files. We can run `grep -r CTF` or `strings * | grep CTF` and find the flag.

**Flag:** `CTF{d3cry471ng_nu3l34r_c0d35}`



#### Father's day dilemma

> Samuel had two children, Dot and Dash, who were extremely fond of numbers. However, they only liked numbers that were greater than 8. For some reason, Dot used to find the number 10 espcially pleasing, it was the same for Dash with the number 12. On Father's day, they came up with a problem for their father to enjoy. Looking at his children, Samuel knew that the problem wouldn't be easy to solve and at the same time would involve numbers.
>
> Can you help Samuel find the hidden message in the file? The answer format is CTF{hidden message}, all caps, no spaces.

We are given two files - `index.html` and `styles.css`.

    <h1>Capture the Flag!</h1>
    <div>
        CTF in computer security is an exercise in which "flags" are secretly hidden in purposefully-vulnerable programs or websites.
          Competitors steal flags either from other competitors or from the organizers.
            Several variations exist, including hiding flags in hardware devices.
            Competitions exist both online and in-person, and can be advanced or entry-level.
          The game is based on the traditional outdoor sport of the same name.
        Flags are often stylised with a combination of letters and numbers such as FYC2022{y0u_h@v3_f0uND_th3_fl@G!}.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        Security CTFs are usually designed to serve as an educational exercise to give participants experience in securing a machine.
          Often, the tasks involve conducting and reacting to the sort of attacks found in the real world.
            Classic CTF activities include reverse-engineering, packet sniffing, protocol analysis, programming, cryptoanalysis among others.
            In an attack/defense style competition, each team is given a machine to defendâ€”typically on an isolated competition network.
            Teams are scored on both their success in defending their machine and on their success in attacking the other team's machines.
        A variation from classic flag-stealing is to "plant" own flags on opponent's machines.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        Hardware challenges usually involve getting an unknown piece of hardware, figuring out how to bypass part of the security measures.
            Examples include using debugging ports or using a side-channel attack.
          Jeopardy-style competitions are closer to programming competitions.
            The teams do not directly attack each other, but rather solve challenges posed by the organizers.
          Time is generally not a factor in scoring these competitions, but "first blood" bonus points are often given to the first solver.
        They are extremely interesting to take part in.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        Wargame is another cybersecurity challange played by many people.
            In hacking, the competitors must exploit a system or application, or gain or prevent access to a computer system.
            A wargame usually involves a CTF logic, based on pentesting, URL attacks, password cracking, scripting, IP address spoofing etc.
            Wargames are also used as a method of cyberwarfare preparedness.
        The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence holds an annual event, Locking Shields, which is a live-fire cyber exercise.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        Encoding techniques are often mixed with questions in such events.
            Encoding is the process of converting data from one form to another.
            We can encode the characters of the alphabet into different forms depending on the technique.
            It is not necessary to encoded characters using characters only, one can always use symbols for the same purpose.
        Who knows, the above text might have something to do with the question in hand.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        There is nothing of much importance here.
          If you are really going to look, look carefully somewhere else within the same file.
            That is not to say, that the text here has no significance, it is indeed important.  
          The hidden text in file is almost there.
          Maybe viewing this file in a different way might help, the sentences do seem oddly structured.
        Best of luck!
    </div>

The hint from the challenge description says "dots" and "dashes", which means the challenge might be related to Morse Code. We can notice that each sentence begins with a variable number of spaces. Considering 10 spaces as a `.` and 12 spaces as `-`, we decrypt the morse code to get the flag. I wrote a small script to convert the spacing into morse code.

```python
with open('index.html') as file:
    content = file.readlines()

l = []

for i in content:
    j = 0
    for c in i:
        if c == ' ':
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    l.append(j)

for i in l:
    if i == 10:
        print('.', end = '')
    elif i == 12:
        print('-', end = '')
    else:
        print(' ', end = '')
```

**Flag:** `CTF{PJCOOL}`



#### Heavens and Earth

> The Heavens and the Earth had finally met, and the Angels were finally going to reveal to mankind their purpose. But oh god! A car in 3rd gear broke the railfence, and hit the train the Angels had arrived on (Wait What!?). The heavens and the earth separated again...
>
> Oh, by the way, I swear I did not hide anything in the image
>
> Enwrap the words inside CTF{} and use underscore as the separator.

We are provided with an image.

<img src="./images/heavens-and-earth.jpg" alt="heavens-and-earth" style="zoom:25%;" />

There is a zip file hidden in the image which can be figured out using something like `binwalk`. Unzipping the file gives us two images.

<img src="./images/heavens.png" alt="heavens.png" style="zoom:25%;" /><img src="./images/earth.png" alt="earth.png" style="zoom:25%;" />

There was nothing hidden in the extracted images. If we just take those pixels where the two images are not the same and create a new image, we get a ciphertext.

<img src="./images/result.png" alt="result" style="zoom:33%;" />

The challenge statement hints toward railfence cipher and decoding it gives us the flag.

**Flag:** `CTF{J0IN_W3B_CLUB}`



#### Save our Souls!

> WAV is a proud soldier of Bunker 8, responsible for defending the west border of his country. They were attacked by the enemy at night without any prior information and hence were hit hard. WAV immediately tried contacting Headquarters but his message got corrupted in between and now the Headquarters are unable to respond to their soldiers' message.
>
> Help the Headquarters to decipher the message and help their men! The answer format is CTF{message}, the message exactly in the same format as obtained, no spaces.

We are given a `.wav` file. Opening it in `sonic-visualiser` and adding a stereogram layer shows us the flag.

<img src="./images/save-our-souls.png" alt="save-our-souls" style="zoom:50%;" />

**Flag:** `CTF{WE-NEED-REINFORCEMENTS}`



#### I see numbers only

> Mr. Codeshankar was trying to suspiciously send some data to mafia leader Mr. Pythonarayan. Thankfully he was caught red-handed along with the data he was trying to send. But what was he actually sending though?[Secret Data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kL7XxBsk_jKo7B7i8XU1Wj6vdd3RGxu7/view)

We are given a zip file, which gives us five `.xls` files. Upon opening the files and viewing them, it seems like all values are between `0` and `255`, which somewhat indicates that it might correspond to pixel values of an image. Let's create an image from the pixel values! We can use `pandas` to read the `.xls` file and `pillow` to create the image.

```python
import pandas
from PIL import Image

img = Image.new('RGB', (30 * 5, 62))
pixels = img.load()

for file in range(5):
    df = pandas.read_excel(f'{file}.xls')
    array = df.to_numpy().transpose()

    for j in range(30):
        for i in range(62):
            pixels[file * 30 + j, i] = (255 - array[j][i], 0, 0, 255)

img.save('img.jpg')
```

This gives us our flag.

**Flag:** `CTF{1T5ALL1NNUMBER5}`



#### TVA's Trap

> Nadia is caught in a time loop as the guest of honor at a seemingly inescapable party one night in New York City. In order to get out she has to decode the following text message she gets. The TVA being noobs donâ€™t understand that just encoding is not exactly secure. Can you get the flag and help Nadia get to base ?Flag format: CTF{...}

```

The text looks like it says "8 x 64", which could probably mean that the flag is encoded 8 times with base 64 encoding. Decrypting the same yields the flag.

**Flag:** `CTF{w3c-ctf-z0z2_3ry9t0}`



#### Shakespear and Encoding

> Brutus planned to kill Caesar. However, he hesitated, for he was afraid that Caesar would say `01000100 01010101 01000111 01111100 01011010 00110001 01010110 00101110 01110101 01110000 01110000 00101110 01000011 01110011 01110110 00110010 01110110 01010100 01111110`. What did he say?

The message looks like it is the binary representation of the flag that is probably encrypted using caesar cipher. Converting the binary numbers into characters, we get: `DUG|Z1V.upp.Csv2vT~`. We know that the flag begins with `CTF` and the characters `DUG` are just one character ahead. Subtracting 1 from each character gives us the flag.

**Flag:** `CTF{Y0U-too-Bru1uS}`



#### Locked Out

> Coulson is locked out of Ragtag. Can you help him get back to BASE by finding the flag. He found this image in BIN.Flag format: CTF{...}
>
> [ flag.png](https://ectf.nitk.ac.in/files/b8c4dc3f48419910234bf325eb2da638/flag.png?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyMjksInRlYW1faWQiOjEwOCwiZmlsZV9pZCI6Nn0.Yib6AA.G_h6hdpeiCMZDEvDEH8tysBhgO0)

We are provided with a png file that contains a QR-code. We can use `zbarimg flag.png` to figure out what the QR code is about. The output is as follows:

```
QR-Code:aHR0cHM6Ly9kcml2ZS5nb29nbGUuY29tL2ZpbGUvZC8xRDBtTkp0YThkRFRDY2VCREkycG9YS3AyYlJhMEcya0Ivdmlldz91c3A9c2hhcmluZw==
```

This is related to standard RSA encryption. The prime factorization of the modulus `n` can be found on [Factor DB](http://factordb.com). As we know the factors, we can easily break the encryption using the standard decryption technique or even run [RsaCtfTool](https://github.com/Ganapati/RsaCtfTool) with attack as `factordb` and solve the challenge.

> Submit after enclosing inside CTF{} and separate the words with an underscore ( _ )

We are provided with an audio file. The challenge hints towards `SSTV` communication - a mode to communicate by converting images/videos into sounds. Using an SSTV decoder like `Robot36`, we can retrieve the image.

![sstv](./images/sstv.jpeg)

These are Navy Signal Flags. Using an online decoder link [this](https://www.dcode.fr/maritime-signals-code) one, we find the following text: `UZ1G4 1N SL74VF1FY`. This is a Vigenere cipher which can be decryted using the key `SSTV`.

We are provided with a text file which contains a link related to a Google search. Since we are required to find the time the search was made, we can take a look at the query parameters and find the timestamp, convert it to human readable form and get ourselves a flag.

```

As can be seen, the random number generation isn't secure because the seed is provided as an integer number. We can simulate going back in time by changing the seed backwards and noticing if the generated hashes match that of logged `Bad random values`. Here's the script to find the right flag:

```python
import random
import time
import hashlib

t = round(time.time())

l = [
    hashlib.sha256(str(0.33567959567961436).encode()).hexdigest(),
    hashlib.sha256(str(0.8913897703358419).encode()).hexdigest(),
    hashlib.sha256(str(0.3032054069265432).encode()).hexdigest(),
    hashlib.sha256(str(0.6860829464688437).encode()).hexdigest(),

    hashlib.sha256(str(0.09018146469820387).encode()).hexdigest(),
]

while True:
    random.seed(t, version = 2)
    bad = False

    for i in range(21):
        rand = random.random()
        has = hashlib.sha256(str(rand).encode()).hexdigest()
        if has != l[i]:
            bad = True
            break
    
    if bad:
        t -= 1
        continue

    rand = random.random()
    has = hashlib.sha256(str(rand).encode()).hexdigest()
    flag = f'CTF{{{has}}}'

**Flag:** `CTF{a13a806d175841731b24a01e9af240bc81750967542550a4b3bb77a29a9d291b}`



#### What's in this

> Intelligence has found some wierd material from Mr. Codeshankar(yes, it's him yet again. Sorry, running out of names). Well, Codeshankar isn't giving away the secret so easily this time.[Wierd material](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I-DVkxxdd9hBNQWptCR4Tr_Ju-k_AwoS/view?usp=sharing)

We are provided with a zip archive. Extracting the archive recursively using `binwalk`, we find a few files and folders provided. We do not know the intended solution but just doing `grep -r CTF` finds us the flag.

**Flag:** `CTF{1t5_all_1n_l4yers}`



#### Packman 1

> Packman found this binary pellet but he is "sus" about this. Help the Packman "unpack" the situation. The link is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xhFx0atxYlyEHYfLeZlYqfL8hRRbbk1U/view)

We are provided with a `u-boot legacy uImage` file. We can use something like `binwalk` to extract all required files but that's not necessary for this challenge. Simply doing `string * | grep CTF` gives us the flag.

**Flag:** `CTF{ee_lo_p3ll3t_kh4o}`



#### Lights Off

> Jett has forgotten her password for her bedroom lights. She isn't able to turn off the lights without them. Help her to find out what is the password by reverse engineering the given algorithm. Login to the server to enter the password so jett can turn off the lights.
>
> ```
> nc 40.114.6.167 5555
> ```

We are provided with a challenge file.

```c
int magic(char arr[], int a)
{
    int i;
    int k = strlen(arr);
    int flag = 0;
    a = 25;
    for (int i = 0; i < k / 2; i++)
    {
        if ((i % 2 ? arr[i] + a : arr[i] - a) != ((k - 1) % 2 ? arr[k - i - 1] + a : arr[k - i - 1] - a))
        {
            return 0;
        }
    }
    if (k % 2 == 1 && a < 24 && k == 4)
    {
        return 0;
    }

    return 1;
}
```

The function is fairly easy to reverse. It is adding or subtracting the value `25` based on the parity of positions and doing comparisons. At the time of writing this, the challenge servers have been taken offline and retriving the flag is not possible.



#### Lost Password

> Bob lost his super-secret password to access his coolcoin wallet. Bob knows the password is somewhere in the main file! Help bob retrieve the password so he can spend his coolcoin!

We are provided with a challenge binary. Using `strings` on the binary gives us the first half of the flag. Opening up the binary in IDA or Ghidra gives us the second part of the flag.

  v5[3] = 178;
  v5[4] = 160;
  v5[5] = 180;
  v5[6] = 161;
  v5[7] = 208;
  if ( argc == 2 )
  {
    printf("Checking %s\n", argv[1]);
    if ( !strcmp(argv[1], "mingw.exe") )
    {
      for ( i = 0; i <= 7; ++i )
        putchar(v5[i] - 83);
    }
    else

      puts("WRONG!");
    }
  }
  else
  {

Providing `mingw.exe` as parameter to the binary gives us the remaining part of the flag: `K3R_MaN}`

#### Packman 2

> Packman found the sus thing in the pellet. Now help him find the "password" for the "root" of this problem. Flag format: CTF{password} Link is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xhFx0atxYlyEHYfLeZlYqfL8hRRbbk1U/view)

We are provided the same file as the **Packman 1** challenge. Unzipping the file gives us a linux file system. Since we are asked to find the password for the root user, we take a look at `/etc/shadow` to find password hashes that might be present. In this case, we do find a password entry for the root user `root:rJ0FHsG0ZbyZo:10933:0:99999:7:::`.

The challenge requires us to brute force the hash `rJ0FHsG0ZbyZo` to find the flag. This is a Unix-5 (DES) hash. We can using something like John-the-Jumbo or Hashcat to perform the bruteforcing.

```bash
echo rJ0FHsG0ZbyZo > hash
john hash # takes about 10-15 mins
john hash --show
```

**Flag:** `CTF{ismart12}`



#### Hecker Beluga

> Skittle has a password validator but it is easily reversible. His friend Beluga noticed this, help beluga to show his hecker skills by getting the password.
>
> Flag format: CTF{password}

We are provided with a file that supposedly validates Skittle's password.

```python
def ValidatePassword(password):
    valid = False
    print("Attempting to validate password...")

    if(len(password[::-2]) != 8):
        print("Nah, you're not even close!!")
        return False

    pwlen = len(password)
    chunk1 = 'key'.join([chr(0x98 - ord(password[c])) 
                            for c in range(0, int(pwlen / 2))])
    print("".join(c for c in chunk1[::4]))
    if "".join([c for c in chunk1[::4]]) != '&e"3&Ew*':
        print("Seems you're a terrible reverse engineer, come back after gaining some skills!")
        return False

    chunk2 = [ord(c) - 0x1F if ord(c) > 0x60
                  else (ord(c) + 0x1F if ord(c) > 0x40 else ord(c))
                  for c in password[int(pwlen / 2) : int(2 * pwlen / 2)]]
    rand = [54, -45, 9, 25, -42, -25, 31, -79]
    for i in range(0, len(chunk2)):
        if(0 if i == len(chunk2) - 1 else chunk2[i + 1]) != chunk2[i] + rand[i]:
            print("You're not a real hecker, try again! " + str(i))
            return False
        
    print("Password accepted!")
    return True

print("\n************** Password Validator ***************")
print("Please enter password")
while True:
    if  ValidatePassword(input()):
        exit()
    else:
        print("Try again!")
```

Firstly, let's realise that the length of the password is 16. It looks like it could also be 15 characters because that passes the first check as well but then we can easily figure out that `chunk1` has length 8 and so does `chunk2`.

Let's try reversing `chunk1`. We can see that the first `8` characters of the password are joined together with `key` as separator after subtracting their ascii value from `0x98`. However, in the next if statement every 4th character is considered i.e. the original 8 characters of password subtracted from `0x98`. We can simply perform `0x98 - ascii_value` to retrieve the original 8 characters, where `ascii_value` is the ascii values of the characters `&e"3&Ew*`. This gives us the first 8 characters: `r3verS!n`.

Now, onto reversing `chunk2`. During the CTF, I just figured out the values manually by using pen and paper but you can also use the Z3 SAT Solver to find the password automatically. Here is my script to find the values of `chunk2`.

```python
from z3 import *

r0 = Int('r0')
r1 = Int('r1')
r2 = Int('r2')
r3 = Int('r3')
r4 = Int('r4')
r5 = Int('r5')
r6 = Int('r6')
r7 = Int('r7')

s0 = Int('s0')
s1 = Int('s1')
s2 = Int('s2')
s3 = Int('s3')
s4 = Int('s4')
s5 = Int('s5')
s6 = Int('s6')
s7 = Int('s7')

s = Solver()

s.add(r0 == 54)
s.add(r1 == -45)
s.add(r2 == 9)
s.add(r3 == 25)
s.add(r4 == -42)
s.add(r5 == -25)
s.add(r6 == 31)
s.add(r7 == -79)

s.add(s0 + r0 == s1)
s.add(s1 + r1 == s2)
s.add(s2 + r2 == s3)
s.add(s3 + r3 == s4)
s.add(s4 + r4 == s5)
s.add(s5 + r5 == s6)
s.add(s6 + r6 == s7)
s.add(s7 + r7 == 0)

print(s.check())
print(s.model())
```

Once we have the values, we can reverse the offset addition and subtraction part that is performed on `chunk2` to retrieve the original last 8 characters.

```python
s = [0] * 8

s[7] = 79
s[6] = 48
s[5] = 73
s[4] = 115
s[3] = 90
s[2] = 81
s[1] = 126
s[0] = 72

for i in s:
    if i <= 0x40:
        pass
    elif i <= 0x5f:
        i += 0x1f
    else:
        i -= 0x1f
    print(chr(i), end = '')
```

Using `sherlock`, we can find an Instagram profile by the same name as in the description. Looking at their followers, we see a person who seems to be the owner like the challenge statement describes. The link to the profile is [this](https://www.instagram.com/ashlynbardot/). The bio section of this person says:

#### Memory Lane

The provided URL redirects us to a YouTube channel. Visiting the `About` section of the channel, we find a flag but it's a fake flag. The descrition and challenge name hint us towards the Wayback Machine - a site that maintains an archive of the internet by saving its snapshots. We can use other alternatives to the Wayback Machine too. Visiting the snapshot of the about page gives us the flag.

[This](https://web.archive.org/web/20220119102148/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI_q2zwb5xxgBW0TzfJtw7g/about) is the snapshot we visit.

`127.0.0.1` is also referred to as `localhost`. Taking the sha256 hash of `localhost` matches the one present in the description.

So, we can do a reverse IP lookup and find that `54.239.28.85` is registered with `amazon.com`.

We are provided with a zip archive that contains many images that seem to be parts of the flag. Observing their naming structure, we can combine them all into one big image using something like `Pillow`. Here's my script to combine the images.

```python
from PIL import Image

new_img = Image.new('RGB', (600, 600))
new_pixels = new_img.load()

for i in range(1, 21):
    for j in range(1, 21):
        x = '{0:02}'.format(i)
        y = '{0:02}'.format(j)
        s = x + y + '.jpg'

        img = Image.open(s)
        pixels = img.load()
        w, h = img.size
        
        for p in range(w):
            for q in range(h):
                new_pixels[15 * j + p, 15 * i + q] = pixels[p, q]

new_img.save('new.jpg')
```

We end up with this image, which is not the flag as expected. Let's take a look at what the QR code is using `zbarimg new.jpg`.

<img src="./images/broken.jpg" alt="broken.jpg" style="zoom:33%;" />

The output is `QR-Code:th@nk2_f0r_h3lping`.

Visiting the provided link, we get a login page. The source code has a user validation function.

```javascript
var userAuthentication = function() {
    var username = document.getElementsByName('username')[0].value;
    var password = document.getElementsByName('password')[0].value;
    var hash = sha256(password);
    if(hash === "dfbec338b51c5643ba481625e1075236d3a9a07fbd6393763f253e99024958a4" && username === "admin") {
        window.location = "./q1?username=admin&password=" + password;
    } else {
        alert("Invalid username or password");
    }
};
```

We can try cracking the hash with common wordlists using `hashcat -m 1400 -a 0 dfbec338b51c5643ba481625e1075236d3a9a07fbd6393763f253e99024958a4 ./wordlist.txt` or use a reverse hash lookup online (like [this](https://crackstation.net/)). We find out that the password is `Thisismypassword`. Logging in with the credentials `admin` and `Thisismypassword`, we are redirected to another page. The cookies contain the flag.
